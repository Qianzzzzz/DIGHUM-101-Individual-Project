## Abstract
This project explores the qualitative differences between text generated by artificial intelligence (AI) and text written by humans. Utilizing advanced analytical techniques, including TF-IDF and LDA topic modeling, this study analyzes a dataset of approximately 500,000 texts to uncover stylistic, thematic, and structural variances. The findings highlight the capabilities and limitations of AI in replicating human creative writing, providing insights into potential applications and improvements in AI text generation technologies.
